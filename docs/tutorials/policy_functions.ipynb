    "If you are interested in modifying the German Tax and Transfer System, you can do so by changing the parameters of already existing fuctions (as we did in this (LINK) notebook), or you change the ```policy_func_dict``` itself by changing, adding or deleting functions to the dictionary.\n",

    "In the German System, there are some transfers for low-income families that can´t be received in combination. Per default, GETTSIM will always choose the most favorable transfers and set other transfers to zero. This means that the family/household might be entitled to receive these other transfers, but not in combination with the chosen, more benefitial transfers. This assumption could model the behavior of the households/families in a wrong way, if they do not always choose the optimal transfers (from a monetary perspective). E.g. there could be a social stigma connected to certain transfers or some people simply do not know about some of the available transfers. To account for these frictions, we can turn off this function of GETTSIM so that we see all the transfers a family/household is entitled to, even if the transfers can´t be received in combination. \n",
